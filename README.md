# Hi, I'm Jocelle 👋  
*IT Student | Network Admin Enthusiast | Maker of ChickenOS*

Welcome to my corner of the internet 🐣  
I'm currently building **ChickenOS** — my own operating system and custom kernel called `PoPKernel` (Power of Possibility). This journey into low-level dev is my personal gift to myself and a deep dive into how computers really work.
